  ## Description
  In this app I made all of the back-end. I made a schema that was compatible with the seeds provided. I have all of the routes connected and the sequelize connecting with mysql database. 

  ## Table of Contents

  ## Installation
  Download the files. You may need to adjust the URI to fit your sequilze. 

  ## Usage
  Once you have all the files downloaded, make sure to download the dependencies. After that run the app in your CLI. Open up your favorite CRUD tester and have fun!
